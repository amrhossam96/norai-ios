# Norai

**Norai** is an intelligent analytics and recommendation engine that helps you truly understand your users — not just track them.

Unlike traditional analytics tools that only collect raw data, Norai turns user behavior into meaningful insights. It learns what your users like, how they engage with your product, and what drives their decisions.
